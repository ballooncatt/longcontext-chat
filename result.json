The updrafts in a storm cloud carry water droplets and ice crystals high up, leading to charge separation (for lightning) and the growth of raindrops.\n4.  **However, it's also possible to hear distant thunder before the rain from that specific part of the storm reaches your location.** This is because sound can travel a long way, and the rain might be falling elsewhere in the storm cell or the storm is still approaching you.\n\nSo, while they are closely related, rain often begins around the same time or slightly before the thunder, but you can sometimes hear thunder before the rain arrives at your spot.", "prediction_match": "No"}
